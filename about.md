### CIS 427 final project.
For my final project, I decided to make a webstore using open source technology, and Software as a Service (SaaS) tools. The website itself is an onlinse retail store where buyers can purchase music in the form of cassette tapes, CD's, and vinyl. Inspiration for the project came from a conversation with a friend of mine about a year ago where he was talking about how static sites are all fun and games until you need some database activity. I enjoy making static websites. This propject is a static website. That conversation lingered with me for a very long time until one day, I decided to find out how to make a static site more dynamic. This lead me to various <a hfer='[https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Software-as-a-Service'>Software as a Service</a> tools such as Content Management Systems, Hosting, E-Commerce, and much more! I even found a service for <a href='https://likebtn.com/en/'>like buttons</a>. In the end, I was able to prove to myself that static sites can be dynamic with the right tools.
